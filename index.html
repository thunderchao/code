        <h2>Welcome to {{ page.title }}</h2>
        <p>It should be fairly obvious what this site is about. You will
        find a link to the most recent blog posts to the right, and below
        you'll find links to some of the highlighted/discussed code in
        the blog posts.</p>
        <p>For all of the code you're about to see, keep the following in
        mind: if I say I'm using python, I'm using python 3.x. Don't get
        confused about that. While I could have learned the old, tried,
        and true version that has all kinds of useful modules, the book 
        I started learning python with told me to go for py3k. So in 10
        years when everything is being done in python 3, I will be <em>so
        </em> ahead of the curve.</p>
