### This is a new blog

Ah, that new blog smell. This is a specific-use blog, as opposed to my
other blog, which covers just about anything. You can visit that 
[here](http://blog.nathanielray.com).

This code blog represents all kinds of new things: I'm hosting it on 
[GitHub](http://www.github.com), which I've never used before, parsing it
with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and rolling with [Jekyll
Bootstrap](http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com), both of which are brand new to
me, writing it in markdown, which is pretty neat, and it's going to be
about the stuff that I code, which is something that I've always been
interested in picking up and only now am I applying myself to learning it
and making some cool, useful stuff.

### What you can expect

Soon, I'll be moving away from the bootstrappy feel into something that
fits me better and I aim to post up new (or updated/fixed) code at least
a coulpe times a month, hopefully more often than that.

There will be links to all of my code as well so you can download, play
with, and fork it to your heart's content.

Yay!
