### The Idea

Central to the tabletop RPG is the rolling of dice. In a typical D&amp;D 
4e session, you'll roll a lot of d20s (twenty-sided dice), and then depending 
on what you've got equipped and what powers you have, lots of other dice 
with other amounts of sides. So I set out to write a dice-rolling program. 
After I did that, I wrote a few other versions, but those are for next time.

### The Core

I wanted to build on the simple, standard dice notation of `mds+a`, where
**m** = how many **d**ice with **s** sides **+** whatever **a**dditional 
modifiers should be added. For example, a barbarian wielding a two-handed 
executioner's axe upon landing a hit might do `1d12+5` damage.

For me, I knew I had to elicit three variables from the user, write a randomizer 
that could handle (correctly) those three variables, and then spit out the 
result.

The trickiest part was figuring out how to take a random integer between 
1 and 12 (for a d12) 8 times (for example). In ruby, this is pretty easy, 
since there's the built-in function of `8.times do *whatever*`. In python,
there's no such easy way (a damn shame, I might add), but after a bit of 
googling, I found I needed to use the `itertools` module with the special
`_` character. Both of these were new concepts to me, and I don't quite know
how they work (or why, really), but this is what I ended up with:

{% highlight python %}
def dice_roller(m, d, a):
    #what we're going for: 3d6+10
    sides = 0
    for _ in itertools.repeat(d, m):    #this makes accurate dice rolls
        side = random.randint(1,d)
        sides += side
    roll = str(m) + "d" + str(d) + "+" + str(a)
    value = sides + a
    print('you rolled', roll, 'getting', value)
    return value
{% endhighlight %}

### The Design

Like I mentioned before, I knew I'd have to grab 3 variables from the user,
so I also decided that since the user will have to be looking at a command 
or terminal screen, I 1) might as well make it look alright and 2) incude 
an option to make multiple rolls.

For the prettyfication, I looked around online until I found [Colorama](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) 
and decided on a decent ASCII art maker, [TAAG](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/). 
The end result looks like so in a win7 console window:

Not too shabby. That 'the original' in there is because--as I state in the 
comments in my code, and up above--I ended up making a few versions.

As for the rest of the design, I wanted to keep it pretty simple, just getting 
the info that the program needs. And that looks like this:

{% highlight python %}
times = int(input('how many times do you want to roll? '))
roll_set = {}                           #saving the set in a dict

while times > 0:
    roll = input('\nname this roll: ')  #make sure each name is unique
    m = int(input('how many dice? '))   #integers only on these three
    d = int(input('how many sides? '))
    a = int(input('plus how much? '))
    roll_set[roll] = dice_roller(m, d, a)
    times -= 1

print(roll_set)
{% endhighlight %}

So the user provides how many rolls he or she will be making and the type
of roll, then the program crunches it and spits out a dictionary of the 
rolls. About the names rolls: I had originally thought of this as a character 
generator, or at least for the stats thereof, and so you could name a roll 
'strength' or 'constitution.' Because of the the way I wrote the program, 
each roll needs to have a unique name, because otherwise the program would 
be overwriting the same key/value pair over and over.

Yeah, it's kind of limiting and a bit annoying, but hey, that's why I wrote 
multiple versions!
